HTML recipe book website project for The Odin Project. I used all of the various elements that I learned throughout the course:
headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. I went out of my way to add additional elements not outlined in The Odin Project's
assignment such as a home link back to the index at the bottom of each recipe page, and an embedded link inside an unordered list
from one recipe to another on the chicken-alfredo.html page.

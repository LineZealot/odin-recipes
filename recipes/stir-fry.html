        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box cheapest linguine or spaghetti noodles in pasta aisle</li>
            <li>1 bottle your choice of stir fry sauce</li>
            <li>Pack of pre-cut stirfry beef or stew chunked beef</li>
            <li>1 bag frozen vegetable medley of choice</li>
            <li>(Optional) Sesame seeds</li>
            <li>(Optional) 1 Bottle soy sauce or 3 packets from leftover chinese takeout</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Optional Prep</h4>
        <p>Put beef in a ziplock bag and cover with soy sauce. Store in fridge as long as you want marinaded before
            cooking.</p>
        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Get out a large pot and fill with water. Throw that on the stove top and crank the burner up to max.
                once the water starts boiling turn the heat down to medium and dump the whole box of noodles 
                in there. Make sure to stir occasionally while doing the other steps.</li>
            <li>Grab a big pan and pour a bit of veg oil in there. Open vegetable medley bag and put desired 
                quantity of vegetables in the pan. Turn the heat up to an 8, those veggies are frozen! 
                Once everything starts to sizzle start stirring and mixing everything around slowly to ensure
                 veggies are cooked evenly.</li>
            <li>Once the veggies are almost cooked turn the heat down to 6 and add in the beef. It will fry 
                much quicker than the veggies. Continue to stir slowly to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Check the noodles as they should be done by now. If noodles are at suffiecient level of malleability,
                 strain water out and turn off extra burner.</li>
            <li>Once beef and veggies are done, add all the noodles into the pan and pour an adequate helping of
                 sauce over the whole thing. Start rapidly stirring until all contents of pan are evenly coated.
                  Take pan off heat.</li>
            <li>Serve immediate helpings and store the massive quantity of leftovers.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Sprinkle sesame seeds on top of servings to make you look fancy to your friends.</li>
